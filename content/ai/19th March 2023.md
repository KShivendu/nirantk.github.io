## Introduction
- Confirmed *FOSS* Demos for the hackathon, 2 of the top 3 projects from Github Trending in AI
- Thanks for the intro Ravi Theja, GPT-Index contributor and inMobi DS [PHONE REMOVED]  to Jerry Liu 

## Interesting Links
- Sharing my favourite blog from last few weeks: https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/17/beat-chatgpt-in-a-browser/
- https://mobile.twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1631346749297106958 
- came across this today 

## AI Models
- WASM for LLMs is super interesting, anyone tried? 
- They also trained an LLM to mimic Homer Simpson and itâ€™s apparently better than gpt-4
- It'd be hilarious if the model forgot how to do chain of thought reasoning because of that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 

## Research Labs
- Iit madras or Bombay has research labs you can cold mail them or reach out to other iits they might help or redirect to appropriate org. 

## VC Tool
- Anyone exploring building a tool like this for VCs?  
- Good customers to sell to and solid use case of AI
