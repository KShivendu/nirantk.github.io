# Generative AI Community Guidelines

**Purpose:** The purpose of this document is to establish the behavioral expectations for members of the Generative AI Community. This document is a living document and will be updated as needed to meet the evolving needs of the community.

**Scope:** This document applies to all members of the Generative AI Community, including but not limited to members of the WhatsApp community, members of the mailing list, and all attendees of Generative AI Community events.

**Expectations:** The following standards of behavior are expected of all members of the Generative AI Community:

1. For events announcements, please fill out this form: [Generative AI Events](https://forms.gle/s3Na6t7HzW43wfEX7). These are published here: [Generative AI Events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTftcrqLyUN8N81ekOBsQgWUWqg_t0QKk0Xil49OZKNhSrhHHN3DZRucTo4RJnYGQBYzes0NFxJKAL_/pubhtml)

1. When sharing a link, provide context. Include a brief description of the link and its relevance to the community. This increases the likelihood that the link will be read.

1. For hiring announcements, please fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/DRuZGp9z8UHpC8sw9](https://forms.gle/DRuZGp9z8UHpC8sw9). We will compile these and share them weekly with the group.

1. Actively discourage and reserve the right to ban conversations about proven harm technologies. This definitely includes

   - deep fakes e.g. images, gifs and videos,
   - surveillance technology and tools e.g. face recognition
   - machine learning to predict criminality, caste, gender, or religion

1. If you notice an off-topic discussion, kindly DM the individual to move the conversation elsewhere.

   - Posting irrelevant content may result in removal from the community. Active contributors will be notified via DM, but others may not receive this courtesy.

1. Maintain a thick skin. Disagreements are acceptable, but respect is essential. Disrespectful members may be asked to leave the community.

1. Share publicly and freely available content. Refrain from sharing links that require a login or are behind a paywall. If you cannot share a free link, provide a summary of the content.

1. Avoid exaggeration and sensationalism, e.g., claiming AGI will arrive in 2025 or that AI will destroy the world. Share strong opinions but be prepared for challenges.

1. Self-promotion is discouraged. If you actively contribute to the community, others may be happy to share your work -- ask someone else to post it, mods are often happy to share new things!

1. Disclose any conflicts of interest, such as financial involvement in a company or product, organizational memberships with financial interests, or personal relationships with company founders.

1. [Don't Ask to Ask, Just Ask](https://dontasktoask.com/). Try to find answers yourself before asking, and [mention what you've tried when seeking help](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Ask the question with context >>> Asking the question >> Asking if someone has used X > Asking "Can I ask questions about X?". If you have a question, ask it.

1. Harassment & Abuse: Even a suspicion of such behavior may result in removal from the community. Admins reserve the right to act without evidence. Be especially respectful when interacting with minorities in technology, e.g., based on gender, race, religion, or nationality.

1. Data Usage: Messages in the group may be made public or used for training a bot. We cannot prevent members from downloading chat history.

1. Remember, this community operates as a dictatorship or fiefdom. Feel free to express disagreement, but do not expect admins to comply with your wishes or public pressure.
