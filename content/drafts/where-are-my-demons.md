Repeat the Good Fight but use the Demons as a metaphor here


It is only lately that I've realised that I'm at conflict with myself -- it is only if I've embraced my own demons that I can run into other demons worth killing. And the further I get away from my own demons, the harder it is to find demons which I can kill.

I envy people with demons who are not afraid to kill them. I envy people with demons who are not aware of them - it's those who're like me, aware but afraid, are the ones who're miserable.
