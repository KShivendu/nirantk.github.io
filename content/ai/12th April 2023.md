AI Embedding Models:
- Comparison between OpenAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" and Huggingface models or Sentence Transformers
- Some prefer Huggingface or Sentence Transformers for their use case
- Recommended model: "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2" or "multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1" for semantic search
- Cross-encoder recommended for better scoring mechanisms

AI in News Media:
- Traditional News Media is frightened with AI
- Buzz is hot and controversial
- Interviews conducted on AI opinions

AI Chatroom Plugins:
- ChatGPT Plugins SF hackathon winners announced
- Winners have higher usability than expected
- Indians are no longer playing catch up

AI Conversational Memory:
- Idea of enabling long term conversational memory by vector indexing conversation history
- Langchain has good abstractions around memory

AI Regulation:
- Governments starting to weigh possible rules for AI tools like ChatGPT
- India already working on BharatGPT

AI for Agriculture:
- KissanGPT being used by farmers and hobbyists
- Feature requests being made
- Plans to integrate visual capabilities to detect bad signs in crop photos
- OpenAI being asked for access to multimodal when available in GPT4 API

AI for Finance:
- Idea being toyed with for AI in finance
- Portfolio company looking for tools to help write research reports

AI Datasets:
- Looking for dataset agencies to curate an instruct type dataset

Langchain:
- Langchain webinar with Harrison, Yohei, and others recommended
- Langchain docs recommended for getting started

OpenAI:
- Open source implementation and model weights released for one step image generation model
