There are good reasons why this option is strictly inferior to dedicated vector search engines, such as Qdrant.
We ran both benchmarks using the ann-benchmarks solely dedicated to processing vector data. The difference in performance is quite staggering.
Query Speed Final results show that pgvector lags behind Qdrant by a factor of 15 when it comes to throughput.</description></item><item><title>Exploring AI Applications, Ethics, and OpenAI's Closed Source Approach</title><link>https://nirantk.com/ai/7th-may-2023.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/ai/7th-may-2023.html</guid><description>OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s decision to not do closed source OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya S. explains that OpenAI is not doing closed source because of safety reasons, but because of competitive reasons. He believes models can be improved to the point in the future where it becomes a safety concern. Competitive reasons The competitive reasons mentioned by Ilya S. refer to Microsoft, which is a major investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has been known to use closed source models in the past, which gives them a competitive advantage.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI Group Chat: Resources, Hackathons, and Model Discussions</title><link>https://nirantk.com/ai/6th-may-2023.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/ai/6th-may-2023.html</guid><description>Introduction Group chat transcript on Generative AI Chaotic discussion on various topics Learning Resources Link to a post on what transformers are Cohere has two of the best ML content creators List of top AI-themed newsletters shared 42papers.com recommended Ben&amp;rsquo;s Bites newsletter recommended Hackathon Invitation to join a team in Warpspeed GenAI hackathon Deterministic Output Discussion on making GPT2 or BLOOM model outputs consistent Two ways to make it deterministic: setting temp=0 or setting seeds Pro tip to pursue this line of reasoning and gain first-hand experience Visual Aesthetic Scoring Discussion on AVA dataset and image dataset curation methods Link to a space on huggingface for aesthetic predictor Use of clip interrogator to score generated captions Hallucination and determinism are not related Visual aesthetic scoring is largely a final layer problem Discussion on the limitations of the model Dataset Creation Request for good library references to create datasets for LLMs Discussion on creating a dataset based on few hand-written examples Suggestion to check the terms of service for commercial use Discussion on using a visual QA model to identify errors in a picture Workflow suggestion to detect errors in the image and fix them using models finetuned on those datasets Suggestion to use Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s landing.</description></item><item><title>OpenAI, Google Models, and Hugging Face Developments</title><link>https://nirantk.com/ai/5th-may-2023.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/ai/5th-may-2023.html</guid><description>OpenAI and Google models:

These are observations based on my own experience of 2 years at Verloop.io and helping a few companies hire for similar roles.
Do Seniormost hire first: Start by hiring the senior most person you&amp;rsquo;re going to hire. E.g. start by hiring the ML Lead (assuming you already have a CTO) Have a means to tell that your investment in data science is working out or not Closest to User first: Hire the person who will consume the data to build for the user first Sourcing: Begin sourcing early and over-emphasise two channels: Referrals and Portfolios Typically, in India - expect: ~2 months to close a full time role at early career (0-3 years) and ~3 months to close a mid career (3-7 years) and 6+ months to close a senior hire If a developer has open source code contributions in the last 2-3 years, consider waving off the coding or algorithmic challenge to speed up the interview process Pay above market cash salaries In 12-18 months from now, when your ML Engineer will have internalised all the requirements, company culture and built a bunch of important tooling - she would get an offer which is 2-3x of today.</description></item><item><title>Why I Quit Data Science</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science.html</guid><description>Question from a friend: I am interested in knowing how did you come to this decision of moving to SWE from DS/MLE.

Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high-value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled and unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description></item><item><title>Shreyas Karanth: Moving from SW Engg to Product</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas.html</guid><description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco.

Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description></item><item><title>Annual Letter: Diwali 2019</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019.html</guid><description>I wanted to drop by and wish you a very Happy Diwali!

Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.</description></item><item><title>Don't Bask in Reflected Glory</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/reflectedglory.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2019 00:00:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/reflectedglory.html</guid><description>ये जो लोग-बाग हैं, जंगल की आग हैं Ye jo log baag hain, Jungle ki aag hain The people, are jungle fire क्यूँ आग में जलूँ...

PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description></item><item><title>Tech Talk Tips</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips.html</guid><description>Collection of the Best Advice on Internet that I know about on giving a tech talk.

Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same. Many startup employees have more opportunity costs than the founders themselves.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by the lack of due diligence which candidates do when interviewing with us.</description></item><item><title>The Good Fight</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/goodfight.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2017 00:00:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/goodfight.html</guid><description>In the first few pages of the book Born Standing Up, Steve says something poignant:
One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</description></item><item><title>The BITS Pilani Experience</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/bitsian.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2017 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/bitsian.html</guid><description>There is a invisible binding thread among most BITSian’s - optimistic, easy going, but somewhat pragmatic. The sky is the limit, but most of them realize flying in hot air pockets is easy - it’s the takeoff that hurts.
I guess there is a flavour of cheerful pragmatism that is uniquely BITSian. You can get ice cream and ice cream shakes anywhere - but Sharma’s MNB is uniquely BITSian.

Given my journey, you can imagine my first reaction to questions of work-life balance is fairly unsympathetic.
