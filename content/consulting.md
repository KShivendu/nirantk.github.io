# How can Nirant help you?

## Things to know
I'm Nirant. 

I've about 5 years of experience doing Machine Learning across Big Corps like Samsung Research and Startups in India. 

I'm based out of India, but happy to take calls from PT/ET timezones as well.

I'm a hands on engineer and actively give back.

### What I can do for you

I can-

- Discuss anything about data or Machine Learning which you need help with
- Help you discuss ML hiring, problem approach, deployment challenges, MLOps and more
- Build NLP datasets and models for you
- Can advice you in some technology decisions. I'll choose to say, "I don't know", instead of misleading you
- Tweet/Write and spread the word about you if it helps
- Use your product and recommend it freely to teams I know

## What I cannot do for you

- Recommend candidates or refer friends to join you full time
