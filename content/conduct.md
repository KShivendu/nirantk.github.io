# Generative AI Community Guidelines

Purpose: The purpose of this document is to define the standards of behavior for the Generative AI Community. This document is intended to be a living document, and will be updated as needed to reflect the needs of the community.

Scope: This document applies to all members of the Generative AI Community, including but not limited to members of the WhatsApp community, members of the mailing list and all attendees of the Generative AI Community events.

Standards of Behavior: The following standards of behavior are expected of all members of the Generative AI Community:

1. Share context when sharing a link. Add a short description of the link, and why you think it is relevant to the community. This also increases the chances that the link will be read.

1. If you see an off-topic discussion, please DM the person to move that conversation elsewhere
   - If you post something that is not relevant to the community, you will be removed from the community -- active contributors will be DM'd, no such privilege to others

1. Have a thick skin. Disagreements are fine. If you are unable to be respectful, you will be asked to leave the community.

1. Don't share links to content that is not publicly and freely available. Avoid sharing links to content that requires a login, or is behind a paywall. If you are unable to share a link to freely available content, share a summary of the content.

1. Avoid hyperbole and sensationalism. E.g. AGI is coming in 2025, or AI is going to destroy the world. If you have a strong opinion, share it but expect to be challenged on it.

1. Self Promotion is actively discouraged. If you are a contributing helpful member of the community, we will be happy to share your work - ping someone else and ask them to post it!

1. Disclose any conflicts of interest. If you have a financial interest in a company or product, disclose it. If you are a member of a company or organization that has a financial interest in a company or product, disclose it. If your best friend from college is the founder from that company, disclose that. And so on.

1. Share Knowledge freely. If you have a question, ask it. [Don't Ask to Ask, Just Ask](https://dontasktoask.com/), If you have an answer, share it. Don't be afraid to ask questions, and don't be afraid to share your knowledge.

1. Be respectful of others' time. If you have a question, try to find the answer yourself before asking. If you have an answer, try to find the question yourself before answering. If you are unable to find the answer or question, ask it. If you are unable to find the answer or question, share it.

1. Lastly, this is a dictatorship or fiefdom. You're free to express disagreement but do not expect admins to adhere to your desires, or even public pressure.
