## Research and Breakthroughs
- Oxford University researchers introduce a diffusion model called RealFusion that can generate 360-degree reconstructions of objects from an image.

- Breakthrough for nerf

## NeRF and 3D Art
- Devanshu Tak is a 3D artist who has used NeRF earlier in his work
- Interesting read: https://unsupervisedlearning.substack.com/p/using-large-language-models-effectively. Esp the #4 point around embeddings

## Embedding and Prompt Templating
- Embedding was the biggest reason for using Pinecone and Langchain in the Hasura bot
- Pinecone is used as a vector store
- Langchain gives a good abstraction
- Hasura bot uses openAI embedding
- Chroma bundles store and the embedding call into one from what can be told.

The message in the same link as the URL is not related to the breakthrough.
- https://unsupervisedlearning.substack.com/p/using-large-language-models-effectively: An interesting read about using large language models effectively, with a specific focus on the #4 point around embeddings. The message also mentions the use of Pinecone and Langchain in the Hasura bot for embedding purposes.
