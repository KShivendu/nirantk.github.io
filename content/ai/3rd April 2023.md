## Emergence of Creativity and Intelligence

- Creativity and human intelligence may just be an emergent property of a small number of algorithms operating with a lot of compute power.
- Many respected neocortex researchers believe there is effectively one algorithm for all intelligence.
- Human brains donâ€™t look all that different from chimp brains, and yet somehow produce wildly different capabilities.
- Our own intelligence may just be the emergent combination of a bunch of cheap tricks.

## Miscellaneous

- Someone thanked two phone numbers.
- No other topics were discussed.
