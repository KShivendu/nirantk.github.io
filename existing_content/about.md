## Me in 10 seconds

I am a Machine Learning consultant with a focus on NLP (including search & speech) & Vision systems for 0 to 1 startups.

I've worked in Machine Learning for almost ~5 years, and have written a [book](#book) on Natural Language Processing. Dr. Andrew Ng recommends my work to his CS230 students at Stanford. My blogs have been appreciated by Noble Laureate Dr. Paul Romer. 

I live in Bengaluru, but grew up in Surat, Gujarat.
