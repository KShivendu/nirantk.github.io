Picking Projects #I prioritize projects based on three key factors: High-Value Projects: I seek projects that leverage my expertise and create significant impact for founders, and in return, equitable compensation. Exploring new industries: I enjoy pursuing opportunities that explore different avenues and industries. My goals here are to cross-pollinate my knowledge across many industries. I am exploring healthcare, insurance and consumer products. O1 Visa Alignment: I also consider projects that align with my O1 visa application, such as speaking engagements in North America, hackathon judging, and collaborations with esteemed US or Global institutions. Advisor vs. Consulting #I distinguish between advisor and consulting engagements: Advisor: I dedicate a day or half a day per month to provide guidance and support to early-stage startups, often through longer-term equity deals. Consulting: I operate on a retainer-based model. I don\u0026rsquo;t like having every interaction to be an investment decision and tracking hours. Fees are a function of value derived and how they align with my learning. I like to keep a 30-hour workweek to give me some time to educate myself and explore new ideas. I won\u0026rsquo;t ask you to pay me to learn something. Situational Assessment #My consulting process begins with a situational assessment: I try to understand what the needs actually are: Objectives What do you think the business needs? Metrics How can we decide if it was successful? Values and benefits What do I unlock for your business? This assessment allows me to tailor my recommendations to address your specific needs and goals effectively. By following this approach, I try to understand the root of what we need to do, how I can bring my expertise to the table, and how we measure success, and quantify the impact of the work.
Next steps:
If you got this far, shoot me a short email to hello@nirantk.com about what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for help on. If I think I can help, I\u0026rsquo;ll send you a link to my calendar to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss the project in more detail and see if we\u0026rsquo;re a good fit.
Here are some examples that have caught my interest:
I\u0026rsquo;m a founder building AI for trucking. I know you\u0026rsquo;re not looking to found a company, but I\u0026rsquo;m looking for someone to help me vet a technical co-founder and get my team started on the right foot. I am a technical co-founder looking for a technical partner to help drive some technical exploration/designs while I spend time fundraising and hiring our founding engineers. I am at ABC VC and I\u0026rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on XYZ and help with some due diligence. I am a director at XYZ, and we\u0026rsquo;re interested in building our automation system with ChatAPI. I would love to get your help leading our overseas SW team to see if it\u0026rsquo;s feasible before getting more headcount. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about starting a accounting startup and would love to talk to you about what is feasible with all this agent work coming out recently. Btw, this document is very inspired by Jason\u0026rsquo;s work with me page - I highly recommend you check him out.
