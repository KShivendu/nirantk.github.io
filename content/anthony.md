Hey Anthony!

Here is why we should talk:

1. I've built datasets for a while. Here are some which I released to open sources:
   1. [Hindi2vec](https://github.com/NirantK/hindi2vec) -- this dataset is now part of the IndicGlue task [web here](https://ai4bharat.org/indic-glue), look for BBC News Articles,
   2. Code switching in Hindi->English: Hinglish, [ACL SemEval Paper here](aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.119.pdf), [code](https://github.com/NirantK/Hinglish)
2. I worked as a Data Engineer at [Sundial.so](https://sundial.so) -- working with Dagster, data quality guardrails, picked up bits about data security, worked with data warehouses like Redshift with dbt.
3. I've deployed multiple ML projects across text (chat, NER, Text Classification, Search) and vision (OCR, Segmentation) to production -- mostly across startups.
