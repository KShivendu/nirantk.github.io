Consider this hypothetical: If you're a software engineer who is known to be good at iOS development, you'll find it hard to get job offers outside of iOS development.[1]

The amount paid to you for this will keep improving as you keep getting better at it. Note that this increased pay might still be less than even starting pay in some other fields, say Data Science -- but you've Golden Handcuffs on you now, don't you?

But what if you're someone who enjoys doing iOS development? I'm super happy for you! You'll most likely be great at this and enjoy it.

The discussion gets more interesting when you consider that you're not just a software engineer anymore, but a mobile app developer. Nothing wrong it, just like there is nothing wrong with being a divorce-attorney vs a vanilla lawyer. But when you started, did you know that learning these skills will reduce your optionality in the future?

"Anti-skills" is a catch-all for skills which when advertised take away your future choices. They prevent you from adapting quickly to the changing environment around you. Anti Skills are skills that you don't want to tell people about. 

This has nothing to do with whether it's a good skill to learn or not. Some of these skills are actually good skills to learn.

It might be harder to get out of these impressions at your existing job, because they tend to be sticky. In such scenarios, moving to a different team within the same company or a different company altogether might be good option. I know of atleast one case where someone had to change jobs to get a 'soft' career reset. 

You might be tempted to move up the value chain. In my limited experience, this rarely works out well and is often quite hard to get out of.E.g. You might not want to build a reputation for being good at debugging, but you might want to advertise that you're good at problem-solving. Another example: Good at SQL? No. Great at metrics? Yes.

The worst of these scenarios is that in a few years from now, you are great at something you don't enjoy anymore. And now, it's too late to do something else because you're stuck with it.

[1] Changing to a different role and/or adding skill sets might still be possible within the organisation you already work at. Lateral shifts are usually harder.
