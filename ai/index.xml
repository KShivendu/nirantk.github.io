He believes models can be improved to the point in the future where it becomes a safety concern. Competitive reasons The competitive reasons mentioned by Ilya S. refer to Microsoft, which is a major investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has been known to use closed source models in the past, which gives them a competitive advantage.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI Group Chat: Resources, Hackathons, and Model Discussions</title><link>https://nirantk.com/ai/6th-may-2023.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/ai/6th-may-2023.html</guid><description>Introduction Group chat transcript on Generative AI Chaotic discussion on various topics Learning Resources Link to a post on what transformers are Cohere has two of the best ML content creators List of top AI-themed newsletters shared 42papers.com recommended Ben&amp;rsquo;s Bites newsletter recommended Hackathon Invitation to join a team in Warpspeed GenAI hackathon Deterministic Output Discussion on making GPT2 or BLOOM model outputs consistent Two ways to make it deterministic: setting temp=0 or setting seeds Pro tip to pursue this line of reasoning and gain first-hand experience Visual Aesthetic Scoring Discussion on AVA dataset and image dataset curation methods Link to a space on huggingface for aesthetic predictor Use of clip interrogator to score generated captions Hallucination and determinism are not related Visual aesthetic scoring is largely a final layer problem Discussion on the limitations of the model Dataset Creation Request for good library references to create datasets for LLMs Discussion on creating a dataset based on few hand-written examples Suggestion to check the terms of service for commercial use Discussion on using a visual QA model to identify errors in a picture Workflow suggestion to detect errors in the image and fix them using models finetuned on those datasets Suggestion to use Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s landing.</description></item><item><title>OpenAI, Google Models, and Hugging Face Developments</title><link>https://nirantk.com/ai/5th-may-2023.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/ai/5th-may-2023.html</guid><description>OpenAI and Google models:
