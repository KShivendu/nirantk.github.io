If you're visiting this page, it means you're likely a founder or VC interested in working with me. I'm going to use this document to describe how I choose projects and split my work between advisory work and consulting. If it all makes sense, shoot me an email at [hello@nirantk.com](mailto:hello@nirantk.com).

## Picking Projects
- I prioritize projects based on three key factors:
    - High-Value Projects: I seek projects that leverage my expertise and create significant impact for founders, and in return, equitable compensation.
    - Exploring new industries: I enjoy pursuing opportunities that explore different avenues and industries. My goals here are to cross-pollinate my knowledge across many industries. I am exploring healthcare, insurance and consumer products.
    - O1 Visa Alignment: I also consider projects that align with my O1 visa application, such as speaking engagements in North America, hackathon judging, and collaborations with esteemed US or Global institutions.

## Advisor vs. Consulting
- I distinguish between advisor and consulting engagements:
    - Advisor: I dedicate a day or half a day per month to provide guidance and support to early-stage startups, often through longer-term equity deals.
    - Consulting: I operate on a retainer-based model. I don't like having every interaction to be an investment decision and tracking hours. Fees are a function of value derived and how they align with my learning. I like to keep a 30-hour workweek to give me some time to educate myself and explore new ideas. I won't ask you to pay me to learn something.

### Situational Assessment
- My consulting process begins with a situational assessment:
    - I try to understand what the needs actually are:
        - Objectives
            - What do you think the business needs?
        - Metrics
            - How can we decide if it was successful?
        - Values and benefits
            - What do I unlock for your business?
    - This assessment allows me to tailor my recommendations to address your specific needs and goals effectively.

By following this approach, I try to understand the root of what we need to do, how I can bring my expertise to the table, and how we measure success, and quantify the impact of the work.

**Next steps:**

If you got this far, shoot me a *short* email to [hello@nirantk.com](mailto:hello@nirantk.com) about what you're looking for help on. If I think I can help, I'll send you a link to my calendar to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss the project in more detail and see if we're a good fit.

**Here are some examples that have caught my interest:**

- I'm a founder building AI for trucking. I know you're not looking to found a company, but I'm looking for someone to help me vet a technical co-founder and get my team started on the right foot.
- I am a technical co-founder looking for a technical partner to help drive some technical exploration/designs while I spend time fundraising and hiring our founding engineers.
- I am at ABC VC and I'd love to get your thoughts on XYZ and help with some due diligence.
- I am a director at XYZ, and we're interested in building our automation system with ChatAPI. I would love to get your help leading our overseas SW team to see if it's feasible before getting more headcount.
- I'm thinking about starting a accounting startup and would love to talk to you about what is feasible with all this agent work coming out recently.

Btw, this document is very inspired by [Jason](https://www.jxnl.co/)'s work with me page - I highly recommend you check him out.
