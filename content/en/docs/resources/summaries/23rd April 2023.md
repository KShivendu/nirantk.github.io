## Anthropics pitch deck
- Does anyone have access to Anthropics pitch deck?

## RLHF for instruct models
- OpenAI's John Schulman gave an interesting talk at Berkeley last week on why RLHF was needed to get the instruct models to behave nicely.

## Deepfakes and audio synthesis
- First instance of an Indian politician referring to deepfakes / audio synthesis?

## AI courses and resources
- course.fast.ai for being able to make sense of all of this â€” even as it changes in 2-3 months and we add VQA (Vision) to mainstream OpenAI APIs
- Lot of new work should come from STT and TTS side, including performance improvements like Whisper-JAX in the coming 4-6 month and more important, voice cloning, avatars and the like. They should have their own "Lensa moment" as such if someone markets it well.
- if i had to recommend a course to cover the NLP hands-on with theory - https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-with-transformers/
- You can still pretty affordable (about $2/mo) instances on Fly.io
- If there's anyone interested, Mckay Wrigley is starting a course on Replit on AI dev. The advanced stuff is coming soon but here's the day 0 course. https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1649492404943323136

## ControlNet Inpaint guidelines
- controlnet Inpaint guidelines for A1111. https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/issues/968 [PHONE REMOVED] you can try out with this and let me know how it is working for you.

## Asymmetric vector embeddings for directional similarity search
- From the author of controlnet repo: Hi everyone! Shreyas here, Iâ€™m a product designer at Clari working on revGPT, a chat interface to get on top of everything happening with sales in an organisation ( and a few personal projects:) ). I saw this tweet by the guy who made BabyAGI, with a new approach to vector search & embeddings: https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1650049673770725378?s=46&t=WT1iAtjftW-5_e62F8FZTg

## Hiring for GenAI
- what are some places to hire tech folks interested in GenAI? understanding of how GenAI works and the nuances of embeddings, text processing
- This WhatsApp group ðŸ™ˆ
- I hear OpenAI has some decent folks
- should have a job board :)
- How about a board that takes natural language input from job seekers and start-ups and matches them? Does something like this exist? Shouldn't be hard to build one.
- Looking to hire folks as well - full time or part time! Job board would be ideal

## Tokenization and word embeddings
- I knew tokens used for non English languages is different but looking at the OpenAI bills, it gave me a shock. Some Asian languages take a lot more - is there a comparsion somewhere?
- I havenâ€™t come across a lang2lang comparison. But openAi has a tokenizer you can use to estimate tokens and build a comparison set.
- For tokenization and word embeddings to reduce cost, you may like to use Sentence Transformers / [ something like that ] and pass the Embeddings to OpenAI for completion
- Theyâ€™re also building foundation models
- [PHONE REMOVED] has built a wrapper around openai tiktoken to count tokens in a file or text -

## Image generation with ControlNet
- I was trying to generate an image of "a key ring with the OpenAI logo on it"
- u can use ControlNet canny model https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/ControlNet, just start with the openai logo, select the canny model and give the promptt
- This was controlnet only btw, both canny and hed boundary worked well (you can change that in settings)

## Open domain Q&A and retrieval algorithms
- Anyone working on open domain Q&A type problems or ones which make use of retreievers/dense embeddings?
- Yes I am. My product helps businesses set this up for internal function (esp. customer service and customer success).
- Oh cool, can you share what kind of models and retrieval algorithms you are using?
