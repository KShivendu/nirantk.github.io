If we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and a BigCo, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS in 2019. I was there till April 2021.
We were directly responsible for most Natural Language Processing needs within the business.</description></item></channel></rss>
