Ideally if they really don\\'t need data, they should give a zero knowledge guarantee. They don\\'t use input or output. But could they use intermediate layer info, can their folks eyeball it to improve the system. All those are probably open questions. \\n I think multinationals too will move to start using them. Their models are quite good and it is just a matter of time. \\n They do need more data, just not api platform customer data. \\n Data Partnership: Interesting. \\n Anyone have a list of data partners for Open AI? \\n Nah... They don\\'t talk about how they train their new models either in terms of data or architecture...  Their platform api  data policy is public info though... \\n I spent a day in march at openai office when they have invited some startups. They are very much looking to get more data to train their models from the industry because they have exhausted internet and academic datasets. However their organization is so small that they are able to cater to partnership proposals only from the biggest tech companies right now, all of which are lining up at their door. Over time they may get to your request. \\n Woah, it would have easily made 90%\\'ile in my undergrad randomized algo course at IIT. \\n If it helps, BITS Pilani did not have a randomized algo course — we had a design and analysis of algorithms, which was more analysis than design: And even Turbo does better than on those questions (specially speed!) than I do even today 😅 \\n Replit Codegen model is better than OpenAI Codex in many human eval tasks and at 2.7B params, wayyy smaller than OpenAI Codex, extremely over-trained by Chinchilla metrics \\n Apparently they built this under 2 weeks \\n https://twitter.com/Mascobot/status/1651022921056555008?t=3qozUieRAPdsnScv3XnQLw&s=19 \\n Widely known no? Even GPT3.5-turbo and GPT4 are a Codex iteration, not vanilla LLM? \\n Widely known to maybe scientists, not discussed much I feel \\n Fair, I might be suffering some form of inside-track groupthink here 😅 \\n To many, I wouldn\\'t think it does \\n Aligned, it\\'s a utility like ec2 in 3 years or sooner \\n 100% - this is the difference between AI now and 5 years back. \\n The UX of consuming models was not great up until openai came into the picture. \\n Still kinda sad that HF hasn\\'t learned this well enough tbh \\n Once we have a well supported IR which works across all platforms, serving and consuming models from source would become a lot easier too. \\n They were born at a different time. Compared to their competition at that time(2017-18) they have done well. \\n Almost everyone who does NLP now makes their models work their transformer library. \\n In 2018 we spent half a day finding out how to use a model someone trained lol \\n UX bhi and ML application development pipeline bhi 😅 \\n Stanford NLP 🤌🏼 \\n https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12yzd2a/google_researchers_achieve_performance/ \\n Anyone working on ML on edge here? \\n This looks big \\n Some of this stuff like flash attention is generally applicable even on servers \\n Wow! \\n https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/02/worlds-first-on-device-demonstration-of-stable-diffusion-on-android \\n Some earlier work from Qualcomm \\n Pretty cool.

They trained for a lot more tokens than most people have tried for similarly sized models.  \\n PSA: Dedicated group for music, images, video: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GThJJhoF3cL7QCmrfIoY8J \\n If anyone remotely knows this person.

I prefer python f-strings ofcourse, but the concept is interesting in its own \\n Dust.tt is amazing! \\n Nice looking at the docs \\n i don\\'t get it. what\\'s novel about this? segment, get image caption using any model blip, sam etc. then prompt gpt-4 to create background for photoshoot. then inpaint. right? \\n https://www.linkedin.com/posts/genai-center_ai-generated-pizza-commercial-tools-used-activity-7056952600516046848-mvqm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios \\n @917054124184 is playing with music gen these days \\n Novelty isn\\'t the only dimension. Ease of use is greatly improved and tons of Shopify stores which sell everything from soaps and other trinkets would love this.  \\n oh totally agreed! my initial impression from the post here was that there\\'s something new... technically speaking (as a lot of folks here are technical).  \\n The application. \\n Went through this, this is very useful \\n Resharing the link, as someone has recently joined and is curious about the deck DM\\'ed  \\n Folks any recommendations other than Google Colab for accessing GPUs ? (I\\'m ok with 5-6$ per month cost also) - mostly hobbyist dabbling \\n How\\'s the availability on Amazon Sagemaker? \\n Might not be applicable for everyone, but I think by far the fastest and best experience would be to apply for google cloud startup credits, and use a dedicated A100 for colab. \\n Jupiter on VS Code with Banana on backend will cost ₹150/hour.  \\n ^ banana.dev also has a great free tier for 1 hour of use \\n Should still be good for tinkering use-cases I\\'d guess? \\n Really nice for notebooks / automation / scripting  \\n Yes. Community model templates allow one click deployment. For 50+ models. Simple docs. \\n Kaggle \\n I want to experiment with deploying StableDiffusion and running Gradio/Automatic1111 ... will also want to keep some of the models like Lyriel / Deliberate + Controlnets  etc .. so need storage ~50GB ... I\\'m newbie to serverless .. but I don\\'t think serverless GPUs will cut it for this usecase \\n You can try paperspace, they are undercutting big tech on GPUs. https://www.paperspace.com \\n they have 5GB space on the Gradient .. 🙁 \\n Google Colab is $12 - and 50GB \\n I have been using my Mac Pro as a server at home + socket + multiple LMs. Works like a charm :) \\n You can keep the model storage on hugging face and then use any serverless gpu player to import your model from there directly. \\n Will try this ! \\n This doesn\\'t work, start up credits cannot be used for colab, they have separate billing \\n Yes, but now you can connect a gce vm to colab, giving you persistent sessions and dedicated compute \\n https://research.google.com/colaboratory/marketplace.html \\n Can recommend runpod, stop the instance when not using, will only be charged for storage \\n Buy a 3080 machine. Looks like we are moving back to a world where we all have a desktop at home 😅 \\n On a more serious note, runpod, lambdalabs, fluidstack. Keep moving around 😅 \\n Finally buckled to Google Colab - 100 compute units for 12$ - 2 units per hour for StableDiffusion stuff that I\\'m doing - so 50 hours of stable diffusion for 1000 rs or 20rs / hour FYI. \\n Does anyone know what compute units mean? \\n I asked gpt. this maybe helpful \\n Back to On Prime? 😂 \\n What GPU do they offer at this price? How much RAM for SD? \\n T4 24GB think for this rate \\n \"No One Knows What It Means But It\\'s Provocative, It Gets The People Going\" 🤣 \\n Are these instances persistent? Or do yoh still have to do the google drive hack \\n not persistent \\n Which platform is this? \\n Google cloud \\n For non persistent / spot instances of GPUs GOOG was always in under supply while we were testing.  \\n https://www.chartgpt.dev/ \\n https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35697627 \\n For anyone using Weaviate, do you store all of your metadata in Weaviate or in a different DB? \\n Context: I\\'m using Pinecone and I\\'m saving most of my content in a different db (pinecone has a limit on size of meta data). Want to know if that is required / recommended for other Vector DBs like Weaviate \\n whats the major difference between storing it in vector dbs and something like a numpy array? is retrieval super fast for say 1000s of vectors \\n Yep, our app allows users embed content so we need containerization + expect this to increase significantly (🤞). If you are building a vertical app (only embedding content yourself), numpy is probably ok - others probably have a better view tho \\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TCqGslll-4 \\n https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2', metadata={})]"
