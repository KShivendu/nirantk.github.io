# How can Nirant help you?

## Things to know
I'm Nirant. I'm a software engineer, and I'm here to help you.

I've about 5 years of experience doing Machine Learning across Big Corps like Samsung Research and Startups in India. Here is a little bit more [about me](./about).

I'm based out of India, but happy to take calls from PT/ET timezones as well. I only take a maximum of 2 projects at a time.

### What I can do for you

I can-

- Discuss anything about data or Machine Learning which you need help with
- Build NLP datasets and models for you
- Can advice you in some technology decisions. I'll choose to say, "I don't know", instead of misleading you
- Tweet/Write and spread the word about you if it helps
- Use your product and recommend it freely to teams I know

### Hiring

1. Guidance on sourcing candidates
- I can recommend what to look for in candidates based on their experience, projects, etc.
- You would still have complete control and do your own sourcing
2. Setting up an interview process. This includes assignments, interview stages, interview questions etc.
3. Assessing assignment submissions. This includes feedback on the quality of the work, and if it's a good fit for the team.
4. Taking the ML round interview, specially if it's NLP

## What I cannot do for you

- Do candidates sourcing or complete end to end resume screening or refer friends to join you full time
