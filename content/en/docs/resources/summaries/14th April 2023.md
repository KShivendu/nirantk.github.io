LangChain and Tenacity API
- LangChain uses Tenacity API
- +1 on using Tenacity API
- LangChain has an API for the idea of kids as superheroes

Andrej Karpathy's Neural Nets Video
- Finished watching Andrej Karpathy's video on Neural Nets
- Highly recommended for anyone starting or in the field
- Link to the video playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ

Image Inpainting and Diffusers
- Tried Img2img models for inpainting on an online image
- Asked for suggestions on using diffusers for inpainting
- Link to Stable Diffusion XL beta: https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-xl-beta-available-for-api-customers-and-dreamstudio-users

ChatGPT for GitHub Repository
- Saw a Twitter post about ChatGPT for a GitHub repository
- Link to the demo video of Chat with GitHub: https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/web_loaders/github
- Link to LangChain API for asking questions on a GitHub repository: https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/web_loaders/github

Reflect.Ai and Bard
- Suggested Reflect.Ai for asking questions on a GitHub repository
- Bard is performing well for asking questions on a GitHub repository
- Link to Reflect.Ai: https://reflect.ai/
- Link to Bard: https://github.com/ashishb/Bard

DreamPose AI Model
- Discussed DreamPose AI model that can generate video from image
- Link to DreamPose GitHub repository: https://github.com/johannakarras/DreamPose#finetune-on-sample

Generating Embeddings and Storing in VectorDBs
- Discussed the difference between generating embeddings and storing them in VectorDBs versus providing them directly to the LLM for question-answering
- If the dataset has >4000 tokens, it needs to be chunked and stored in VectorDBs for QA by taking relevant chunks
- If the dataset is <4000 tokens, it can be directly asked to the LLM for QA

AktoGPT and GPT LLM in Production
- Akto.io launched AktoGPT
- Ankush discussed things to watch out for before deploying GPT LLM in production
- Link to AktoGPT: https://www.akto.io/blog/aktogpt
- Link to Ankush's tweet: https://twitter.com/Ankush12389/status/1646779395833741313

LangChain with Azure Endpoints
- Asked if anyone has used LangChain with Azure endpoints instead of OpenAI directly
- Link to LangChain API for using Azure endpoints: https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/azure_openai_example.html

Latency for Commodity Network
- Discussed the latency for 2000 Bytes over commodity network from 2009 to 2020
- Link to the research paper: https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html

Stability Diffusion for Robotics
- CTO of Stability AI talked about Stability diffusion for robotics
- Link to Stability AI: https://stability.ai/

Industry Directions and Opportunities
- Discussed the trends in the industry as a way to understand industry directions and opportunities

Google Colab Link
- Shared a Google Colab link
- Link to the Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VezfmvAg4t1okxs7pJ0qp0pWDAaW7mlo?usp=sharing
