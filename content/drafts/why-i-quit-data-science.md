Question: I am interested in knowing how did you come to this decision of moving to SWE from DS/MLE.

## What kind of research did you do to get to this decision?

I spoke to a lot of people who were both big companies and startups. I also spoke to folks across multiple markets: Singapore, India, US & Europe. I primarily spoke to people with more than 10-12 years of experience. This is a big difference in my perspective.

## What were your considerations while making this decision?

### Skill Stack

This is how I understand the world today: There are 3 primary functions around data: data engineering, modeling (e.g. predictive) and data analytics.

I could keep going deeper into modeling e.g. learning more about CNNs and Transformers. Between writing the NLP Book and professional Machine Learning, I'd guess that I'm in top 20-30% of the world doing this. The journey to get from here to being the best is hard and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

I'd much rather add another skill and get to the top 25% in it -- and then quickly rise to the top on it's intersection. This will also be easier as I've tons of novelty and new ideas to learn. 

Since analytics roles are neither well respected nor well paid, I'd rather be a platform/data enginer than a data analyst.

### Competition

Within this, let's talk separately about pre-series D startups and big companies (e.g. FAANG/MAGA) for modeling roles. Startups are usually open to hiring folks without a MS/PhD degree, while big companies are more open to hiring folks with a PhD. 

For modeling roles at big companies you will be competing with folks with a PhD. For startups, I often see they end up hiring better trained folks as they scale up and relegate older, less 'specialised' folk to roles closer to engineering (e.g. API Design, uptime) and away from modeling.

It's also much harder for me, personally to find truly exceptional Machine Learning mentors, but relatively easier to find proven, battle-tested quite senior engineers. And as much as you might underestimate the role of coaching, I believe that in our craft - it can save you 4-5 years of learning time.

### Title/Impact

I've the least confidence on this being true over a longer duration. But I'm mentioning it here since a lot of senior people do think about this. 

Growing within modeling-related roles is hard and you hit the ceiling as Head of Machine Learning. Notice that in most of the cases, you are not even Head of Data, you're Head of Research or ML or some function within Data.

## What was/is the goal of this particular switch? What were you trying to optimize?

I'm optimizing for being great (but not best) at the intersection of 2-3 things instead of 1 narrowly, clearly defined role. I'm trying to get to the top of the intersection. 

I was also bored by the mundanity of problems you encounter in typical early-stage startups. The need to trade off personal-notion-of-quality for speed is sometimes a bit of a problem, but I usually enjoyed the challenge.

## What information did you find for and against this switch?

Stepping away from Machine Learning Lead roles can be a massive cash and title/designation downgrade. It definitely turned out to be true for me. 

My alternate job offer was a Machine Learning Lead, instead of a Platform Engineer. I would not be happy with the role, but I'd be very happy with the salary. It'd be 3-4x in cash, and 4-5x in total compensation terms. Another way to look at this, I took at 75% cut on my cash compensation.

I'm betting that I'll have a lot more fun doing this, but I'm also betting that I'll be a little more successful - which will compensate for this over a 4-10 year chapter of the career.
