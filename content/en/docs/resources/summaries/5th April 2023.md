## OpenAI Embeddings and Graph Embeddings
- Discussion on utilizing OpenAI embeddings model to create graph embeddings
- Naive approach suggested: use "text-embedding-ada-002" to get node embeddings and compute edge embeddings using adjacency matrix
- Pinterest recommends starting with any base embedding and then updating them
- Article on HN shared for reference

## GPT Model for Financial Data and Analysis
- Query on availability of GPT model finetuned with financial data and analysis
- Mention of Bloomberg GPT, but not yet usable or publicly available
- Doubtful if it will ever be open sourced as it is trained on proprietary data

## Generative AI Mixer Event
- Invitation to a generative AI mixer event at Lightspeed office in Koramangala
- Interested participants asked to fill up a Google form

## Deepfake Detection
- Query on research happening in deepfake detection and any good app/software for it
- Mention of Spoofsense.ai working on it
- Microsoft's effort on disinformation and deepfakes shared, but no working model for public
- Discussion on not releasing authenticators to avoid making it easier for next generation of cheaters to evolve/reverse engineer
- Mention of Yahoo's nudity detection model from 7 years ago

## API for Categorizing Questions
- Query on API to categorize questions into HR, Finance, Marketing, etc.
- Offer to create one over the weekend if given 20 samples
- Discussion on using GPT4 in Google Sheets to classify questions

## OpenAI Credits
- Discussion on how to get more than $1K/month hard limit of OpenAI
- Mention of it being expensive, with 5K questions a day

## Prompt Injection in GPT4
- Discussion on the status of prompt injection in GPT4
- Experimentation with prompt injection and simulation of another agent with different ideals in chatGPT and GPT 3, 3.5
- Mention of GPT4 being good with handling prompt injections and sticking to the system prompt

## Miscellaneous
- Mention of RISC-V International event in India
- Query on the largest OpenAI customer in India
- Sharing of article on Zero Knowledge Machine Learning and its use case in medical data inference
- Mention of HuggingFace launching a GPT4 alternative, Vicuna 13B
