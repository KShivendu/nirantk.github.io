## Topics Discussed in Chaotic Generative AI Group Chat Transcript:

### AI Art Generation Workflow
- Discussion on using Stable Diffusion for AI art generation.
- Workflow involved using text2img with controlnet depth map of the image.
- Depth map was obtained from Clipdrop's API.
- Automatic1111 was used for the entire process.
- Iteration loops were run in every step until satisfied with the output before moving to the next step.
- Retakes are common in AI art generation.
- Fascination with how a deterministic input can give infinite non-deterministic output.
- Non-deterministic output still stems from a classical random number generator.
- The concept of seeds is simple but quite useful.
- There are infinite seeds in theory.

### AI Tools and Plugins
- Discussion on Langchain agents and ChatGPT plugins.
- Certain things are easier and more fun with a UI.
- Depth maps provide more control.

### AI Learning
- Suggestion to try few-shot learning for training.
- Ran out of context length before stuffing enough context for significant improvements.

### Humor
- Ran out of context length before stuffing enough context for significant improvements ðŸ˜‚
- This debate itself is infinite ðŸ˜†

### Social Links
