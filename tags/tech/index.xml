There are good reasons why this option is strictly inferior to dedicated vector search engines, such as Qdrant.
We ran both benchmarks using the vectordb framework solely dedicated to processing vector data. The difference in performance is quite staggering.
Query Speed Final results show that pgvector lags behind Qdrant by a factor of 15 when it comes to throughput.</description></item><item><title>Airbnb's Metric Store: Minerva</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/minerva.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/minerva.html</guid><description>Data lineage is a problem because most companies have several tables and queries before humans consume it!
This has well known challenges: changes do not propagate downstream from the source, and reliable (fresh, updated or complete) data is not always available.
What does Minerva do? I was expecting Minerva to a database (collection of tables), but it turns out that Minerva is what I&amp;rsquo;ll call: Data Transformation Manager.
It overlaps quite a bit with dbt but it&amp;rsquo;s not a pure execution layer.</description></item><item><title>Data Science Org Design for Startups</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/data-science-org-design.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/data-science-org-design.html</guid><description>Data Science Org Design for Startups While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist - I think very little discussion happens on the organization design for Data Science itself.
This blog will hopefully help folks not just build their team, but also understand the ecosystem from which they are hiring.
Organization Design is determined by these 3 broad categories:</description></item><item><title>How to Read a Deep Learning Paper</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/read-deep-learning-paper.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/read-deep-learning-paper.html</guid><description>Who is this for?

Why Do We Need Instructions on How to Read a Deep Learning Paper? Quantity: There are more papers than we can humanly read even within our own niche. For instance, consider EMNLP - which is arguably the most popular Natural Language Processing conference selects more than 2K papers across a variety of topics.

I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.</description></item><item><title>Building a Data Science Team at a Startup</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/building-a-data-science-team.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/building-a-data-science-team.html</guid><description>Hello!
If we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and a BigCo, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS in 2019. I was there till April 2021.
We were directly responsible for most Natural Language Processing needs within the business.</description></item><item><title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</guid><description>Update, September 2021: This guide is a little outdated, but not obsolete. I no longer work at Verloop.io.
Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.</description></item><item><title>Math for Machine Learning</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/mathforai.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2019 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/mathforai.html</guid><description>Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, andi Optimization Theory For Computer Science and Machine Learning https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/math-deep.pdf

Some ideas/papers/tools on monitoring models in production. A use case would be say a classification task over large inputs. I want to visualise how are the predicted values or even confidence scores vary over time? (paraphrased)
Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/
Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.</description></item><item><title>Best of Python 3 f-strings</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/pythonfstrings.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/pythonfstrings.html</guid><description>This piece is primarily meant for those new to Python.

PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description></item><item><title>Tech Talk Tips</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips.html</guid><description>Collection of the Best Advice on Internet that I know about on giving a tech talk.

Let us get our facts straight, shall we?
I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.</description></item><item><title>The Case Against Work Life Balance</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/imports/sankar-wlb.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2015 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/imports/sankar-wlb.html</guid><description>Note from Nirant: This is an archived blog post from here by Syam Sankar.

I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty to copy paste the raw text:
Given my journey, you can imagine my first reaction to questions of work-life balance is fairly unsympathetic. I want to protest that, by legitimizing such a false dichotomy, you’re pre-empting a much more meaningful conversation.</description></item></channel></rss>
