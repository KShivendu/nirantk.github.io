Our benchmark informs that pgvector lags behind a robust vector database like Qdrant by a factor of 20 when it comes to throughput e.g Queries per second.
Indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s a 2000% speed deficit! But speed isn&amp;rsquo;t the only metric to consider when evaluating a database; accuracy is just as crucial. Regrettably, pgvector falls short here too, delivering a disappointing 18% fewer relevant documents than Qdrant.</description></item><item><title>ML Model Monitoring</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/modelmonitoring.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 00:00:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/modelmonitoring.html</guid><description>Mayank asked on Twitter:
Some ideas/papers/tools on monitoring models in production. A use case would be say a classification task over large inputs. I want to visualise how are the predicted values or even confidence scores vary over time? (paraphrased)
Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/
Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.</description></item></channel></rss>
