Hey Anthony!

Here is why we should talk:

1. I've built datasets for a while. Here are some which I released to open source:

   - [Hindi2vec](https://github.com/NirantK/hindi2vec) -- this dataset is now part of the [IndicGlue task](https://ai4bharat.org/indic-glue), look for BBC News Articles
   - Code switching in Hindi->English: Hinglish, teammate wrote ACL SemEval Paper [here](aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.119.pdf), [code](https://github.com/NirantK/Hinglish)

2. I've worked as a Data Engineer at [Sundial.so](https://sundial.so) -- working with Dagster, data quality guardrails, picked up bits about data security, worked with data warehouses like Redshift, Bigquery with dbt.

3. I've deployed multiple ML projects across text (chat, NER, Text Classification, Search) and vision (OCR, Segmentation) to production -- mostly across startups. I have written a [book](https://nirantk.com/about#book) on Natural Language Processing. Dr. Andrew Ng recommends my work to his CS230 students at Stanford. My blogs have been appreciated by Noble Laureate Dr. Paul Romer.
