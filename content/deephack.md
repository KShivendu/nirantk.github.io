## FAQ

### Can I work on my own startup idea?

The demo day is only for ideas developed during the hackathon.

The demo day is not for startups who want to showcase their products built using Generative AI. You can and should libraries (e.g. Langchain, LLama Index) and boilerplate code libs (e.g. Tailwind). It is also okay to do some homework before the hackathon on what approaches, libraries/APIs you want to use and have that all in place when you begin.

If you want to showcase the work your startup is doing, please reach out to The Fifth Elephant team at Hasgeek which is organizing forums for such opportunities.

### Can I work on a project that I have already started?

Yes, you can work on a project that you have already started. But in the interest of fairness, please do not work on a project that you have already made a lot of progress on, say 60% completed.
