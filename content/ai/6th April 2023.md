## Links
The description and link can be mismatched because of extraction errors.

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01852: Is he masking the cloth first, and then doing style transfer? Even then, the results look near perfect and artefact free, unlike what style transfer or img2img can do. This came out two days ago ðŸ‘†.
- https://github.com/sangyun884/HR-VITON - This link was shared along with a message asking if anyone has tried a paid subscription of MidJourney from India, as the person's payments were not going through. The link itself is not directly related to the message.
- https://youtu.be/E7fGsSNKMc4: A cool video link, possibly unrelated to the mention of a personal Citibank Indian Master credit card.
- https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper - This link leads to a blog post about finetuning speech-to-text models for Indian languages, which was requested by some teams.
- https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper: This link provides information about finetuned STT for Indian languages, which was requested by some teams.
- The URL https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-models is related to dataset and wave2vec models, and the message in the same link as the URL is related to MetaAI's Twitter account.
- https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb: 3000 rows is pocket change. For any indie hackers, you can use Google Sheet as a db to launch a GPT4 app as well.
- https://huggingface.co/vasista22/whisper-hindi-large-v2: Indian government has fine-tuned checkpoints for this model and the message also asks if there is an API available for it.
- https://gooey.ai/asr/ - The message mentions the URL as a self-plug for an API related to the question of whether there is an API available. The message also mentions that a notebook related to the URL had some problems with finetuning examples.
- https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/6df6ceff470eeba26a56de131254e775292eac22/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-1-collect-data.ipynb - A contributor of OpenAI Cookbook is asking how to make money.
- https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1643628476505681920?s=20 - The message discusses the limitations of LLMs and the need for alternative solutions in AI. The mentioned URL is related to the topic.
