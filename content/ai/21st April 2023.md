- Kubiya.ai resource shared and discussed
- Helm charts and K8s clusters can be managed via chat interface using natural language
- Discussion on the evolution of computer engineering from command lines to GUIs and back to command lines

AI Techniques:
- Advanced stable diffusion techniques for inpainting and controlnet discussed
- Tutorial on creating consistent AI characters across images with SD shared
- Request for AI art/text to image group
- Proposal for a separate DeepMedia: Generative Art (Text to Images, Video, Music) group
- Illustrated Transformers and other resources shared

Pinecone:
- Discussion on hybrid index and querying with only dense embeddings on Pinecone

Miscellaneous:
- Request for a public xlxs doc to keep track of shared links
- Discussion on the need for separate image and text to action groups
- Mention of in-context learning and Microsoft paper on the topic
- Use of Markdown suggested for organizing group chat discussions.
