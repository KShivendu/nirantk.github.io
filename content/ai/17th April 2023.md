- langchain discord has a "ask-kapa-langchain" channel for asking doubts, with a useful bot based on the langchain docs and codebase, and integrated with https://www.mendable.ai/. The bot allows to ask queries on discord chat and generates the answer in a thread. (URL not provided)
- The Kapa Langchain bot is Discord-based and generates answers in a thread. The message also asks if the website https://www.paradox.ai/solutions/recruiters has automated screening of resumes.
- Does this also have automated screening of resumes? (related to the links)
