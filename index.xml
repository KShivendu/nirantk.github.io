This has well known challenges: changes do not propagate downstream from the source, and reliable (fresh, updated or complete) data is not always available.
What does Minerva do? I was expecting Minerva to a database (collection of tables), but it turns out that Minerva is what I&amp;rsquo;ll call: Data Transformation Manager.
It overlaps quite a bit with dbt but it&amp;rsquo;s not a pure execution layer.</description></item><item><title>Beyond First 90 Days</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/beyond-first-90-days.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/beyond-first-90-days.html</guid><description>This one&amp;rsquo;s gonna be brief and echoes 2 Less Obvious Ideas to the younger me.

These are observations based on my own experience of 2 years at Verloop.io and helping a few companies hire for similar roles.
Do Seniormost hire first: Start by hiring the senior most person you&amp;rsquo;re going to hire. E.g. start by hiring the ML Lead (assuming you already have a CTO) Have a means to tell that your investment in data science is working out or not Closest to User first: Hire the person who will consume the data to build for the user first Sourcing: Begin sourcing early and over-emphasise two channels: Referrals and Portfolios Typically, in India - expect: ~2 months to close a full time role at early career (0-3 years) and ~3 months to close a mid career (3-7 years) and 6+ months to close a senior hire If a developer has open source code contributions in the last 2-3 years, consider waving off the coding or algorithmic challenge to speed up the interview process Pay above market cash salaries In 12-18 months from now, when your ML Engineer will have internalised all the requirements, company culture and built a bunch of important tooling - she would get an offer which is 2-3x of today.</description></item><item><title>Why I Quit Data Science</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science.html</guid><description>Question from a friend: I am interested in knowing how did you come to this decision of moving to SWE from DS/MLE.

Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high-value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled and unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description></item><item><title>Shreyas Karanth: Moving from SW Engg to Product</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas.html</guid><description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco.

Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description></item><item><title>Annual Letter: Diwali 2019</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019.html</guid><description>I wanted to drop by and wish you a very Happy Diwali!
