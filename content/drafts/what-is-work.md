Achieving without looking like you're trying to achieve is actually much harder. 

Work as Ethic
Work as Duty
Work as Survival
Work as Play

This post is a continuation of Sajith Pai's 'Work as Play' in his [Shower Thoughts](https://sajithpai.com/venture-capital-startups/shower-thoughts/). Here is an excerpt from the post:

> An alternate framework to ‘shower thoughts’, and one I have often used is that **high performance workers dont see the work they do as ‘work’**, i.e., something that needs to be dealt with for 5-6 hours and then moved on from. Instead they see work as play. The find it easy and enjoyable. This is what is referred to the in the saying “Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” (source unknown)

(emphasis mine)

I like bullet lists, so let me break this down into how I understand this: 
1. The desired goal is to be a high performance worker or hire one. 
2. 


One of the most interesting shifts and paradigms of last 20-30 years in Indian elite circles was the acceptance for what I call high visibility hard work. For instance, some of the most popular enterpreneurs of today openly talk about hard it is.

This has few interesting outcomes: 
1. It helps people understand that there is a deep and personal cost to doing hard things e.g. enterpreneurship
2. It also summarily led to the rejection of "Passion hypothesis" i.e. that success comes from doing things you already like or are excited about
    - For the curious, the nuance is that you like doing things which you're are good at, and that keeps you excited/addicted. So the trick is to get so good at something, that no one can ignore you

Winning is now going to be talked about in terms of human values
