## Generative AI Meetup
- Nvidia-HF event on Saturday morning
- Online event, URL: https://sites.google.com/huggingface.co/generative-ai-meetup
- Need an experienced person to guide and answer queries, volunteer needed
- Twitter link for volunteer: https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1651677221797371904?t=UAtNw7WFH00_AS5oGpirUw&s=19

## AI Applications
- Using diffusion for detection/recognition/segmentation tasks
- Tesla using diffusion as part of their lane detection algorithm
- Transformers used for lane detection, URL: https://youtu.be/aVjDX5XshYo
- Text2motion
- Promptlayer
- Data exploration and feature engineering resources needed
- Sequential prompting for controlled conversation, e.g. roleplay
- AlignmentAI and PMGPT for guided chat with roleplay
- AI assistant/co-pilot for product managers/product teams
- GPT plugins

## AutoGPT
- AutoGPT for basic questions
- AutoGPT's limitations
- AutoGPT's marketing
- Large scale human feedback and nudges for AutoGPT

## Namefinder.ai
- Namefinder.ai for product names
- Suggestions for AI assistant/co-pilot names

## GPT-4 API Access
- Technical folks waiting for GPT-4 API Access
- GPT plugins
- Azure OpenAI service

## FP8
- FP8 based on NVIDIA's Transformer Engine
- Faster inference and more Fp16, Fp8/int8 proliferation for task-specific models
- Impact on large model, faster model, or new model arch

## Serverless GPUs
- Serverless GPUs and cost savings
- Market competition dictating pricing instead of arbitrary end user value

## Langchain
- Building with Langchain
- Private V2 for collectiv LangchainX

## Code Summarization
- Tools for summarizing custom code repos/documentation

## Links
The description and link can be mismatched because of extraction errors.

- https://sites.google.com/huggingface.co/generative-ai-meetup: A link to a website for a generative AI meetup, with a message requesting an experienced person to guide and answer queries.
- The first URL is a tweet requesting guidance and answers from an experienced person, while the second URL is a news article about MEPs sealing the deal on an artificial intelligence act. The context suggests that the person is seeking guidance on the topic of artificial intelligence. The URLs are:

- The use of transformers for lane detection is discussed in a YouTube video (https://youtu.be/aVjDX5XshYo) and a related research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00390).
- They use transformers for lane detection- https://youtu.be/aVjDX5XshYo and https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00390, text2motion
- https://tsmatz.wordpress.com/2023/03/07/react-with-openai-gpt-and-langchain/ - The message in the same link as the URL criticizes the practice of touching a GPU for custom embedding in 2023, calling it a "very 2016 thing to do" and a "late stage hype cycle thing to do."
- https://www.namefinder.ai: Still waiting for someone to name their product bhAI. Names like samurAI and ikigAI are already gone. A dairy founder wanted g.ai but had to resort to mal.ai.
- https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/index.html (related to the impact of NVIDIA's Transformer Engine on FP8 performance)
- https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1636394074101153792: The message in the same link as the URL discusses the potential for market competition to dictate pricing for serverless GPUs.
- https://github.com/peterw/Chat-with-Github-Repo: A user is asking for tools that can summarize custom code repos/documentation and provides an example link for reference.
- https://github.com/mtenenholtz/chat-twitter: A request for tools that can summarize custom code repos/documentation, with an example link provided.
- The given URL https://github.com/peterw/Chat-with-Github-Repo is related to a chat application built using GitHub repository. Another URL https://stability.ai/blog/deepfloyd-if-text-to-image-model is also mentioned, but the context is not clear.
