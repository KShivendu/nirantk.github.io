OpenAI Demo and Productivity Tools:
- OpenAI demo of wireframe to working code was impressive
- Discussion on how it could be used for productivity tools like email, document writing, and slide creation
- Some productivity and note apps may become irrelevant after this technology

Deep Learning/NLP:
- Discussion on various resources for learning about deep learning and NLP, including courses and papers
- Recommendation to watch Karpathy's nonogpt video
- Discussion on studying existing models and their building blocks
- Xavi Amatriain's catalog may be overwhelming for beginners
- Non-technical questions are welcome

Transformers and Fine-Tuning:
- Discussion on how transformers have taken over the field previously dominated by RNN variants
- Fine-tuning any LLM is tricky
- Prompt optimization may be more lucrative than fine-tuning
- Prefix/prompt tuning may be the way to go for applications

Art and Stable Diffusion:
- Discussion on using Stable Diffusion for art and prompt engineering
- Playgroundai and civitai.com mentioned as resources
- Prompt engineering changes with each new release
- Next step after playing with basic prompts on Midjourney and Dall-e may be exploring image2image, in-painting, out-painting, and instruct pix2pix
- Discussion on integrating text2image providers with full-fledged tools like Canva and Photoshop

Research and Emergent Properties:
- Discussion on how bigger models have more emergent properties
- Question on whether there are works that show when these properties arise during training

Miscellaneous:
- Discussion on organizing an activity for Bangalore folks
- RNNs are fighting back
- Link to Google palm blog post on scaling language models
