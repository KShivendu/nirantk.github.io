Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high-value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled and unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=./writing/standout.html class="link black dim">Standing Out at Work</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In my short career, I&rsquo;ve seen some amazing young people stand out at work.

You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=./writing/picking-startup-to-work-with.html class="link black dim">Picking a Startup Team You Want to Work With</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Why we need to do a reference check on startup teams we work with?

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=./writing/actlike35.html class="link black dim">Act Like You're 35</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Don’t just network with people your own age Beware the whiz kid syndrome.
